A humble try to define everything as code

## Why? 

As an engineer who has been born into the cloud-native world, I grew up with "Everything as code" is the way to do it. So that's why I'll try here in this repo, to define common infrastructure things like Tailnet's, DNS, repositories, workspaces and more in code.

## How?

I signed-up on [Terraform cloud](https://app.terraform.io/session) and created an organization for my Github user with one default project and workspace in it named like this repository. I installed the Terraform cloud Github App into my account so that VCS-driven workflows can act on my behalf.

Everything in that workspace has been created/configured manually.

## Renovate

Renovate has been configured using Mend's SaaS version. You can access it at [developer.mend.io](https://developer.mend.io)

## Tailscale

Signed-up using Github, some settings can only be defined in the UI.

Configures basic settings and ACL's.
